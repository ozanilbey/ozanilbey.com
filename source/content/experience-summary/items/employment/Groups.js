  <>
    I worked at Grou.ps as a <strong>Product Manager</strong>; however, I was mostly dealing with <strong>design and development</strong>. I almost entirely designed and developed <Link type="external" href="//graphjs.com">GraphJS</Link>, a <strong>client-side library</strong> for enabling social features (messaging, following, etc.) on any website. Then I worked on building <Link type="external" href="//grou.ps">Grou.ps v2</Link>, using powerful features of GraphJS. I also worked on rebranding company and products.
    <Information>I am also co-founder of GraphJS.</Information>
