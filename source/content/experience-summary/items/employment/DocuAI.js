    I was <strong>employee #1</strong> in Docu.ai, providing a <strong>swiss-army-knife</strong> type of work. I <strong>designed and developed the core product</strong> of the company, along with its website. I created <strong>the brand</strong> and prepared all the <strong>marketing materials</strong> (including how-to-use videos). On top of all these, I worked on backend, improving the <strong>data extraction AI</strong> and creating/managing datasets.
